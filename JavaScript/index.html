1.What is JavaScript?
Ans.
1.Client-Side Scripting Language
JavaScript primarily runs in the browser and allows web pages to become interactive (e.g., dropdowns, modals, animations).

2.Dynamically Typed
Variables in JavaScript do not need a type declaration; the type is determined at runtime.

3.Supports Object-Oriented, Functional, and Event-Driven Programming
JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language that supports various programming styles.

4.Runs in the Browser and on the Server
Originally for browsers, JavaScript can now run on the server using environments like Node.js.

5.Uses the DOM (Document Object Model)
JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS through the DOM, allowing dynamic content updates.

6.Asynchronous Programming with Promises and async/await
JavaScript supports asynchronous operations, useful for APIs and non-blocking code execution.

7.Single-threaded with Event Loop
JavaScript is single-threaded but uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations efficiently.

8.Interpreted, Not Compiled
JavaScript code is interpreted line-by-line by the browser, making it easy to debug and test.

9.Large Ecosystem and Community
JavaScript has vast libraries (like React, jQuery) and frameworks (like Angular, Vue.js), making development faster.

10.Used for Full-Stack Development
JavaScript is used in both frontend (React, Vue) and backend (Node.js), enabling full-stack web development.


2.What is the difference between let, var and const?
Ans.
var:var is a global scope variable.
let:let is a block scope variable.
const:const is a block scope variable.

3.What is hoisting in JavaScript?
Ans.Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
example:
console.log(a); //undefined
var a = 10;
console.log(a); //10


4.What is the difference between == and ===?
Ans.== is used to compare the value of two variables, while === is used to compare the value and type of two variables.
example:
console.log(1 == "1"); //true
console.log(1 === "1"); //false


5.What is the difference between null and undefined?
Ans.null is an assignment value that represents no value, while undefined is a default value that is assigned to a variable that is not yet defined.
example:
console.log(null == undefined); //true
console.log(null === undefined); //false

6.What is the pure function and impure function?
Ans.A pure function is a function that always returns the same output for the same input, and does not have any side effects.
example:
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
console.log(add(1, 2)); //3

7.How many way we have to handle async operation in javascript?
Ans.There are 3 way to handle async operation in javascript:
1.Callback
2.Promise
3.Async/Await

which one is best and why?
Ans.Async/Await is the best way to handle async operation in javascript because it is easy to read and write.
example:
async function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
console.log(add(1, 2)); //3

8.What is Higher Order Function in JavaScript?
Ans.A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument or returns a function.
example:
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
console.log(add(1, 2)); //3

example:
map, filter, reduce, forEach, etc.

9.what is the difference between map and forEach?
Ans.map is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of the array, while forEach is used to iterate over the array and perform an action on each element.
means map return a new array and forEach return undefined.
example:
console.log(arr.map(x => x * 2)); //[2, 4, 6]
console.log(arr.forEach(x => x * 2)); //undefined

10.What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous?
Ans.Synchronous is a programming paradigm that executes code in a sequential manner, while asynchronous is a programming paradigm that executes code in a non-sequential manner.
example:
console.log("Hello");
console.log("World");

11.what is the difference between filter and find method?
Ans.filter is used to filter the array and return a new array, while find is used to find the first element that matches the condition.
example:
console.log(arr.filter(x => x > 2)); //[3, 4, 5]
console.log(arr.find(x => x > 2)); //3

12.What is event loop in javascript?
Ans.Event loop is a loop that checks the call stack for function calls and executes them.

13.What is the difference between call, apply and bind method?
Ans.call, apply and bind are used to call a function with a different this value.
call method:call is used to call a function with a different this value.
apply:apply is used to call a function with a different this value and arguments.
bind:bind is used to call a function with a different this value and arguments.
example:
console.log(arr.call(x => x > 2)); //[3, 4, 5]
console.log(arr.apply(x => x > 2)); //3
console.log(arr.bind(x => x > 2)); //3

14.Give me 5 difference between normal function and arrow function?
Ans.
1.

15.Can we use this keyword in arrow function?

16.What is the difference between function expression and function declaration?
Ans.Function expression is a function that is stored in a variable.
Function declaration is a function that is declared with the function keyword.

17.What is the difference between first class function and higher order function?
Ans.First class function is a function that is treated as a variable.
Higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument or returns a function.

18.var a = 10;
{
    var a = 20;
}
let b = a;
{
    let b = 30;
}
console.log(a); //10
console.log(b); //30
