1.What is React?
Ans.
1. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. React was created by Facebook (now Meta) in 2013.
3. React uses components - reusable pieces of code that can be combined to build complex UIs.
4. React uses JSX - a syntax that lets you write HTML-like code in JavaScript.
5. React follows a virtual DOM approach - it creates a copy of the real DOM in memory for faster updates.
6. React is declarative - you describe what you want, not how to do it step by step.
7. React is component-based - you break your UI into small, reusable components.
8. React has one-way data flow - data flows from parent to child components.
9. React is efficient - it only updates the parts of the DOM that actually changed.
10. React has a large ecosystem with many tools and libraries like React Router, Redux, and Next.js.

2.What is JSX?
Ans. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files.

3.Why do we use JSX?
Ans. JSX is used to create React elements.

4.What is ReactDOM?
Ans. ReactDOM is the library that we use to interact with the DOM.

5.What is React Router?
Ans. React Router is a library that we use to handle routing in React.

6.What is Redux?
Ans. Redux is a library that we use to manage state in React.

7.What is Next.js?
Ans.
1. Next.js is a React framework for building fast, production-ready web applications.
2. It enables server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) out of the box.
3. Next.js supports file-based routingâ€”pages are created by adding files to the `pages` directory.
4. It offers API routes, allowing you to build backend endpoints within your Next.js app.
5. Next.js provides automatic code splitting, loading only the necessary JavaScript for each page.
6. It supports image optimization with the built-in `next/image` component.
7. Next.js enables incremental static regeneration (ISR), allowing you to update static content after deployment.
8. It has built-in support for CSS and Sass, as well as CSS-in-JS solutions.
9. Next.js offers fast refresh for instant feedback during development.
10. It is widely used for SEO-friendly, performant, and scalable web applications.
10 Differences between React and Next.js:

1. **Type**:  
   - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  
   - Next.js is a full-fledged framework built on top of React.

2. **Rendering**:  
   - React supports only client-side rendering (CSR) by default.  
   - Next.js supports server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and client-side rendering.

3. **Routing**:  
   - React does not have built-in routing; you need to use libraries like React Router.  
   - Next.js has a built-in file-based routing system.

4. **Configuration**:  
   - React projects require manual configuration for features like SSR, routing, and code splitting.  
   - Next.js comes with sensible defaults and built-in features, requiring less configuration.

5. **SEO**:  
   - React (CSR) is less SEO-friendly out of the box.  
   - Next.js (SSR/SSG) is highly SEO-friendly.

6. **API Routes**:  
   - React does not provide backend/API routes.  
   - Next.js allows you to create API endpoints within the same project.

7. **Performance Optimization**:  
   - React requires manual optimization for code splitting and image optimization.  
   - Next.js provides automatic code splitting and built-in image optimization.

8. **Deployment**:  
   - React apps are typically deployed as static files to any static hosting service.  
   - Next.js apps can be deployed as static sites or serverless functions, and are optimized for platforms like Vercel.

9. **Data Fetching**:  
   - React handles data fetching on the client side.  
   - Next.js provides multiple data fetching methods (`getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, etc.) for different rendering strategies.

10. **Community and Ecosystem**:  
    - React has a larger ecosystem with many third-party libraries for routing, state management, etc.  
    - Next.js has a more opinionated ecosystem with many features built-in, reducing the need for extra libraries.

8.Why do we use keys in React?
Ans. Keys help React identify which items in a list have changed, been added, or been removed, making updates faster and more efficient.

9.What is virtual DOM and how it different from real DOM?
Ans. Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM that React uses to track changes. It is faster than the real DOM because it does not have to re-render the entire DOM tree.

10.What is React Hooks?
Ans. React Hooks are a way to use state and other React features in functional components.

11.How are many typed of hooks are there in React?
Ans. There are two types of hooks in React:
1. State Hook
2. Effect Hook
3. Context Hook
4. Ref Hook
5. Memo Hook
6. Callback Hook
7. Reducer Hook

12.What is the difference between State and Props?
Ans. State is the internal data of a component that can be changed, while props are the external data that is passed to a component. so props are immutable and state is mutable.

13.What is the difference between useCallback and useMemo?
Ans. useCallback is used to memoize a function, while useMemo is used to memoize a value.
