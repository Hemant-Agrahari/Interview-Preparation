1.What is Reactjs?
Ans.ReactJS is a free and open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications (SPAs). It allows us to create reusable UI components that manage their own state, making the process of building complex interfaces more efficient and maintainable.
React was developed by Facebook and is maintained by both Facebook and a large community of developers.
React is a library for web and native apps.

key features of reactjs:
1.Declarative:Declarative programming is a programming paradigm that describes how to achieve a result, rather than explicitly specifying how to achieve it.
2.Component-Based:React is built around the concept of components. A component is a self-contained module that renders a part of the UI.
3.Learn Once, Write Anywhere:React can be used to build web applications, mobile apps, and even desktop applications.
4.One-Way Data Binding:React uses a one-way data binding system, which means that data flows in one direction, from parent components to child components.
5.Virtual DOM:React uses a virtual DOM to optimize the rendering of the UI.
6.Server-Side Rendering:React can be used to build server-side rendered applications.
7.Testing:React has a large community of developers who contribute to the library, which means that there are many resources available for testing React applications.
8.Performance:React is designed to be fast and efficient, which means that it can handle large amounts of data and complex UI.
9.Scalability:React is designed to be scalable, which means that it can handle large amounts of data and complex UI.
10.Flexibility:React is designed to be flexible, which means that it can be used to build a variety of applications.

2.What is Single Page Application?
Ans.A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. This approach avoids interruption in the user experience while allowing the user to use all the functionality of the application.

3.What is Virtual DOM?
Ans.The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. It is a tree of React elements that represents the structure of the UI. When the state of the application changes, the Virtual DOM is updated, and React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one to determine the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM. This approach significantly improves the performance of the application by reducing the number of DOM manipulations.

4.What is JSX?
Ans.JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. It is a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript. It is used to describe the structure of the UI in a more declarative way.

5.Why do we need React?
Ans.React is a library for building user interfaces. It is used to build single-page applications and mobile apps, as well as to build complex user interfaces for web applications.

6.What is react fragment and why do we need it?
Ans:React fragment is a way to return multiple elements from a component. It is used to return a list of elements from a component.

7.List out type of Hooks in reactjs?
Ans.There are seven type of hooks in reactjs:
1.useState
2.useEffect
3.useContext
4.useReducer
5.useCallback
6.useMemo
7.useRef

8.What is the difference between state and props in reactjs?
Ans.
1.State is the data that is managed by the component itself, while props are the data that is passed to the component from the parent component.
2.state is mutable means we can change the value of state and props are immutable means we cannot change the value of props.
3.state is local to the component, while props are global to the component.
4.state is used to store data that is managed by the component itself, while props are used to store data that is passed to the component from the parent component.
5.state is used to store data that is managed by the component itself, while props are used to store data that is passed to the component from the parent component.

9.What is the difference between functional component and class component in reactjs?
Ans.
1.Functional component is a function that returns a React element, while class component is a class that extends React.Component and returns a React element.

10.What is the lifecycle of a component in reactjs?
Ans.The lifecycle of a component in reactjs is the process of how a component is created, updated, and destroyed.
1.Mounting:The component is created and added to the DOM.
2.Updating:The component is updated and re-rendered.
3.Unmounting:The component is removed from the DOM.

11.What is the difference between useCallback and useMemo?
Ans.useCallback is used to memoize a function, while useMemo is used to memoize a value.
